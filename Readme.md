# ðŸš€ My Node.js Learning Journey ðŸš€

## Overview

Welcome to my Node.js learning journey repository! This week, I've embarked on exploring the fundamentals of Node.js, and I'm excited to document my progress here. Despite the festive season of Diwali, I've managed to make some significant headway, and I look forward to continuing this adventure.

## Progress So Far

### Week 1 Highlights:

- **Introduction to Node.js:** Kicked off my learning with the basics of Node.js.
- **Modules:** Gained an understanding of how to use modules effectively.
- **Path and OS Variables:** Explored the path and OS variables to enhance my knowledge.
- **Networking Session:** Attended a valuable session titled "Unlocking the Power of LinkedIn for Networking and Career Growth," hosted by GeekRoom.
- **Hackathon Preparations:** Participated in team discussions in preparation for the upcoming hackathon.

As we continue through the festive season, this week has been particularly busy due to Diwali celebrations.

### Week 2 Highlights:

- **Todo List Application:** Attempted to build a todo list application using Node.js and Express.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Tried integrating MongoDB for data storage.
- **Challenges:** Encountered some problems that I need to tackle. If I canâ€™t resolve them on my own, I plan to ask my seniors for help.

## Week 3 Highlights:

- **Restarting My Node.js Journey:** I've decided to restart my Node.js journey. Although I learned a lot previously, I struggled to fully understand the concepts due to limited coding time and multiple assignments and vivas awaiting in college. Now that things have slowed down, I have ample time to code, and Iâ€™m excited to code while I learn.
  -I restarted my Node.js journey on Friday. I learned how Node.js works, how it was created, and how to use it after re-understanding the basics.
- **Basic Coding Practice Friday:** I wrote some simple code to add two numbers and write the result into a file named `output.txt`.
- **Saturday Learning:** I learned about the basic theory of DNS, HTTP, and servers. Additionally, I created a small request generator that listens constantly on a given port.

## Week 4 Highlights:

- **Sunday Learning:** I learned about the basic theory of Request .
- **Monday Learning:** I learned about the basic theory of Response. Additionally , I created a simple server that listens on a given port and responds to a given request. which creates simple form to get input data from user and then sends it to server.and prints that data in simple text file .
