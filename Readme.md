# Node.js Projects

This repository contains my Node.js learning journey and projects.

## Folder Structure

- `OLD JS/` - Contains all the code from when I first started learning Node.js. This includes:
  - Basic JavaScript files
  - Request/Response handling examples
  - NPM and Express.js introductory projects
  - MVC architecture implementations
  - Practice exercises

- Other folders (to be created) - Will contain new backend projects as I continue developing with Node.js

## Usage

To explore my initial Node.js learning path, check the files in the `OLD JS/` directory. New projects will be added in separate folders at the root level.
